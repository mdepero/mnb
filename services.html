<h1>Services</h1>

<h3>What else does Miami provide to enhance your laptop experience?</h3>

<ul>
	<li>On campus hardware repair - Miami is a certified repair depot for Dell and Apple. If you have a hardware problem with your Miami Notebook, certified technicians provide repair services to you under the vendor's warranty, which means there is no charge to you.</li>
	<li>Loaner Laptops - If your Miami Notebook needs to undergo a prolonged repair while you are on campus, you'll be given a loaner notebook* to use until your Miami Notebook is repaired.<br />
	* In rare instances, loaner demand may exceed the supply. If that occurs, we will maintain a wait-list and fulfill loaner requests as quickly as loaners are returned. To avoid this situation, please consider having your laptop serviced at the time that the problem occurs; do not wait until the beginning or end of the semester, as this introduces a longer wait for repairs and, in some cases, a loaner may not be immediately available.</li>

	<li>Pre-configured for Miami - Miami Notebooks come ready for use at Miami and include a variety of tools that are needed to access Miami services and network. The software page contains a more comprehensive list of these tools.</li>
	<li>Discounts on out-of-warranty repairs - It is our sincerest hope that your computer never needs out-of-warranty service. Unfortunately, our experience shows that no matter how excellent the computer, there are still situations in which you may need help with a repair that goes beyond the warranty (such as removing malware or viruses, getting windows installed on a Mac, or upgrading the operating system). Because we know the ins and outs of your computer before you purchase it, we are able to offer reduced prices on such repairs -- many being free. And don't forget you'll have a loaner computer while yours is in the shop!</li>
	<li>Accidental Damage Protection (Dell Miami Notebooks only)</li>
	<li>Accidents do happen. If one happens to your Dell Miami Notebook, you can have it repaired, or even replaced if necessary, as part of your CompleteCare warranty.</li>

	<li>For Apple Miami Notebooks: Accidental damage is not covered by Applecare warranty but is available with the additional purchase of Safeware insurance (see below).</li>

	<li>Full service vendor warranty - Traveling during a semester break? Home for the summer? If you need vendor support while away from campus, your Miami Notebook is backed with premium support from Apple or Dell. You can have your Miami Notebook repaired by any certified Dell or Apple vendor in the U.S.</li>
	<li>The vendor warranty begins on the date of purchase or the date your Miami Notebook ships from the Miami University Bookstore.</li>

</ul>



<h1>Safeware</h1>

<p>Protect your Investment: Unlike the Dell counterpart, an Applecare warranty does not cover accidental damage. Furthermore, the cost of repairs of Apple laptops not covered by the warranty can be very expensive. Purchasing Safeware protection adds Accidental Damage Protection to your Applecare warranty through a Third Party Administrator (Safeware) at a reasonable price. All Plans are backed by a highly rated AM Best Insurance Company.</p>

<p>Safeware, a leader in providing protection solutions for technology for over 30 years, offers Accidental Damage coverage for Apple products. By purchasing this additional coverage, you can eliminate the out-of-pocket expense associated with the repair or replacement resulting from accidental damage. Below are examples of what repairs of an Apple Laptop could cost based on a damaged screen or damage related to a user spilling liquid onto a laptop.</p>

<h3>How it Works</h3>
	<p>
		You purchase the appropriate Product Protection Plan card within the first 60 days of purchasing your Apple Miami Notebook. You scratch off the silver box on the back of the card to display the activation code. You then go to the Safeware web site listed on the card, fill out your personal information and input the activation code. You will receive a confirmation email confirming your registration. Please save the email for future reference. Your new Apple laptop will be covered for four years against accidental damage.
	</p>

	<p>
		If you were to damage your laptop while on campus at Miami, you would take your laptop to IT Services Remediation Center at Miami for repair. You will need to supply the technician your Safeware policy number and a copy of the email. After verifying the coverage, your laptop would be repaired at no cost to you.
	</p>

	<p>
		If you were to damage your laptop while away from Miami, you would call 1-800-800-6132 and speak to Safeware support. After working with the technician, you will either be instructed to take the laptop to a local certified repair facility or Safeware will send a box and shipping label to ship the laptop in for repair.
	</p>

	<p>
		Safeware is an addition to your AppleCare warranty and covers accidental damage but has some limitations:
	</p>
<ul>
	<li>Repairs may take longer than paying for Tier 4 repair service directly from Apple</li>
	<li>In the event of a depot repair, Safeware only uses Apple Authorized Service Providers. No repair performed should void an active AppleCare Warranty.</li>
	<li>If the damage exceeds $1,000, a claim review must take place to determine the current value of the computer versus the repair cost.</li>
	<li>It is possible that your computer will have to be replaced with an equivalent refurbished laptop. Refurbished units may be used, but we would not replace with an after-market unit. The unit would be send from an AASP/Reseller.</li>
	<li>Coverage does not include consumable items, such as the battery, cosmetic damage, or normal wear and tear.</li>
</ul>
